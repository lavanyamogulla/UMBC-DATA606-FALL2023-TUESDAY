## PROJECTS
- #### Suspicious Activity Detection Using Deep Learning In Secure Assisted Living.  
This project aims to create a robust deep neural network model for people detection, tracking and distance estimation to aid in the reduction of coronavirus spread and economic costs by providing AI based solutions to monitor and detect violations of social distancing among individuals automatically.

- #### Emotion Based Music Recommendation System.  
With my developing interest in tackling real-world problems, I chose a machine learning-based project as my mini-project, intending to create a song recommendation system based on the user’s emotion via facial expression.

- #### Intuitive Learning on Basic Geometry.  
Developed a  website using HTML, JS, Flask  which demonstrates mathematical calculations of projective geometry and we can solve the basic questions of geometry.

## ACCOMPLISHMENTS
- Instructed students in STEM subjects as an educator at STEMtree Fairfax, promoting a passion for science and technology during summer break.  
- Published an International Journal in IJCRT on the project “Suspicious Activity Detection Using Deep Learning In Secure Assisted Living” which is based on Machine Learning and AI technologies.  
- Participated in CSHACK2020, a government-sponsored hackathon event in the Healthcare and Biomedical devices domain.
